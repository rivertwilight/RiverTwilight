I write code to craft. Started when I was 14, though that matters less than what I've actually built. You can find some of my crafts at [ygeeker.com](https://www.ygeeker.com).

If you have ideas, email me. Simple ideas executed well beat complicated ideas executed poorly. The best collaborations often start with a casual conversation.

And since you're reading this: do things that matter to you. Most people spend their lives doing what they think they're supposed to do instead of what interests them. Don't fall into that trap.
